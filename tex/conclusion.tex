In hindsight there is no regret of choosing the more complex solution to the problem, it did not only give us more understanding of how to solve the problem we were given in an intelligent way but we also managed to successfully implement the quadratic sieve algorithm to achieve maximum score in KATTIS. Of course the solution can be optimized further but considering the time constraints we are satisfied with our work.
