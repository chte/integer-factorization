For our implementation we used several papers as reference. One that really come handy
lecture notes by Carl Pomerance \cite{Pomerance05smoothnumbers}. We implemented a naive
quadratic sieve using only single polynomial paradigm.

The program can be divided into three general phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item calculating smoothness bound and generate factor base
\item sieving
\item gaussian elimination
\end{itemize}
