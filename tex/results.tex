These tests were solely based on the score and running time on the 
\texttt{KATTIS} problem \texttt{oldkattis:factoring}.

\paragraph{Primality testing}
At first we just tried to do a primality test with Miller-Rabin. 
The results can be seen in table

 \textbf{Score} 1   \textbf{Running time} 0.01s 
                          

\paragraph{Quadratic sieve}

We implemented a naive Quadratic Sieve from start and
at first with bad B smooth boundary. It had
unoptmizied sieving functions, we did handle perfect powers.

This yielded a result on Kattis as shown below.

 \textbf{Score} 85   \textbf{Running time} 13.56s 
                          

By improving on the problems mentioned above and tweaking the smoothness boundary
B which regulates the factor base size aswell as the number of linear relations,
i.e how many extra smooth numbers, we managed to get 100 points score on Kattis.

 \textbf{Score} 100   \textbf{Running time} 4.32s
