{\bf Notation.} By 'log$_b$' we denote the base $b$ logarithm and the natural logarithm denotes by ln=log$_e$ with $e \approx 2.71828$. 
The largest integer $\leq x$ is denoted by '[x]'.  The number of primes $\leq x$ is denoted by '$\pi(x)$', and due the \emph{Prime number theorem}\cite{Hardy2008}
we know that $\pi(x) \approx x / $ln$(x)$ .

{\bf Modular arithmetic.} Throughout this paper '$x \equiv y$ mod $n$' means that $(x-y)$ is a multiple of $n$ whereas $x,y$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\ne 0}$.
Similarly, '$x \not\equiv y$ mod $n$' mean that $(x-y)$ is not a multiple of $n$. 
Euclid's algorithm for finding the \emph{greatest common divisor} of two non-negative integers, say x and z, is denoted by gcd$(x,z)$.
